## Grocery Shooping List

# What We Will Build
Created a hypothetical grocery shopping list for a user. We will do the following operations:

- In our Spring application, we define a grocery item Plain Old Java Object (POJO) with ID, name, quantity, and category.
- Next, we perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations using MongoRepository public interface.
- Finally, we show an alternate approach for updating documents using the MongoTemplate class.

Obs: In this Spring Boot MongoDB project, I'm not using the Controller and the View. I'm will use a CommandLineRunner to view the output on the console.
